Security context

Like in docker you can specify the user and his capabilities. You can configure them at the pod level or at container level. If you configure
both the settings and the container the settings on the container will override the settings in the pod.

Let's define a pod definition file where the security context is set at the pod level

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
	name: web-pod
spec:
	securityContext:
		runAsUser: 1000
	containers:
		- name: ubuntu
		  image: ubuntu
		  command:
			- sleep
			- 3600


And at the container level, at the container level you can also specify capabilities, this is available at the container level, not at the POD level:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
	name: web-pod
spec:
	containers:
		- name: ubuntu
		  image: ubuntu
		  securityContext:
			runAsUser: 1000
			capabilities:
				add: ["MAC_ADMIN"]
		  command:
			- sleep
			- 3600

To open a terminal in the container simply type:
  . k exec ubuntu-sleeper

So In order to get the user of a pod you can simply type:
 . k exec ubuntu-sleeper -- whoami
