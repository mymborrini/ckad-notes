Node Affinity:

The primary feature is to ensure the pods are hosted on particular node. Node affinity gives us a list of expression to be sure
that we placed our pod in the node we want to place them. 

With great power cames great complexity

So this two expression are equals:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
	name: myapp-pod
spec:
	containers:
		- name: data-processor
		  image: data-processor
	nodeSelector:
		size: Large

----

apiVersion:
kind:

metadata:
	name: myapp-pod
spec:
	containers:
		- name: data-processor
		  image: data-processor
	affinity:
		nodeAffinity:
			requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
				nodeSelectorTerms:
					- matchExpressions:
						- key: size
						  operator: In
						  values:
						  	- Large	


Other example:
				nodeSelectorTerms:
					- matchExpressions:
						- key: size
						  operator: NotIn
						  values:
						  	- Small

Or if the values does not bother us.
				nodeSelectorTerms:
					- matchExpressions:
						- key: size
						  operator: Exists


What if node affinity could not match a node with the given expression
In this case we check the nodeAffinity that will tell us what happened if at runtime the affinity changes:

There are two types on node affinity (Available)
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution 
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution 

and one planned
requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution

To fully undestand these three consider that there are two lifecyle in the Pod affinity,
 during scheduling is the pod in the state where it's not created yet
 during execution when the pod is created and running and something change in the state of the node, for example removing
the label or a selector.

If DuringScheduling Is Required and no node has the affinity, then the node will not be scheduled.
If DuringScheduling Is Preferred and no node has the affinity, then the node will be placed on any available nodes

If DuringExecution Is Ignored any changes in node affinity will not impact them once they are scheduled and running
If DuringExecution Is Required any node which does not meet the affinity rules even at runtime will be evicted.
