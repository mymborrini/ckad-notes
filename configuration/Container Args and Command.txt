Kubernets command

Regarding the Docker command file we have created a new image with sleep by default 5 seconds

	FROM ubuntu
	ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
	CMD ["5"]

Let's create a pod for this specified image

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
	name: ubuntu-sleeper-pod
spec:
	containers:
		- name: ubuntu-sleeper
		  image: ubuntu-sleeper

Now if you need to specify that the ubuntu should sleep from more seconds how you specify it in the pod definition? 
With args you override the cmd
With command you override the entrypoint

	containers:
		- name: ubuntu-sleeper
		  image: ubuntu-sleeper
		  args: ["10"]
		  command: ["sleep2.0"]

Now let's see how to set environment variables, in Docker is something like this:
 . docker run -e APP_COLOR=pink simple-webapp-color
In kubernetes we simply add an env, which is an array of plain key value

	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Pod
	metadata:
		name: simple-webapp-color
	spec:
		containers:
			- name: simple-webapp-color
			  image: simple-webapp-color
			  ports:
				- containerPort: 8080
			  env:
				- name: APP_COLOR
				  value: pink  

			  
There are other way of setting environment variables like configMaps and Secrets the difference in this case is that we don't specify a value but a valueFrom


	env:
		- name: APP_COLOR
		  valueFrom: 
			configMapKeyRef: 

	env:
		- name: APP_COLOR
		  valueFrom: 
			secretKey:
