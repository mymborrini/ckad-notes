MONITOR AND DEBUG

What would like to monitor?
I like to know 
Node level metrics such as:
 . number of nodes
 . how many of them are healthy
 . CPU, memory, network and disk utilization


Pod level metrics such as:
 . number of pods
 . CPU, memory 
  

So we need a solution to collect this data and analyze them.
K8s does not come with feature for monitoring solution, however there are a lot of metrics server opensource you can use such as:
Metrics server, Prometheus, Elastic Stack, DataDog, Dynatrace


For now let'see Metrics server.


Heapster was the original project that enable monitoring and analyze for k8s.

Heapster is now deprecated and a slim version born named Metric Server. Online you will find a lot of reference to heapster, this is why this is somehting important to kwow.

Metric Server retrieve all of the k8s nodes and pods and stores them in memory. Metrics server is just an in-memory solution and does not store anything on the disk, as a result you
cannot se historical performance data.


KUBELET is the k8s agent installed in each node, is responsible to receive instraction from the master. Kubelet contains also a subcomponent CADVISOR. CADVISOR is responsible to take
all the metrics (from pods) and expose them through the kubelet api to make the metrics available to the metrics server 


You then clone metrics-server from github and then run it as a k8s application
 . k create -f metrics-server/deploy/1.8+/...

This commands deploy a bunch of pods, service, roles ecc... to enable metrics server.  
Then you can type 
 . k top node (to view node performance)
 . k top pod (to view pod performance)
