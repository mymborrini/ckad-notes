LOGGING:

Logging in docker:
Just type: (the -f variable means that the log keep being updated otherwise it will be static)

docker -logs -f <containerId>

In K8s:

k logs -f <podName>

So more or less is the same, but what happened if there are multiple docker containers inside a single pod?
You must specify the container -name

k logs -f <podName> <containerName>
