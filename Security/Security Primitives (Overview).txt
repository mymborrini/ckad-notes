SECURITY PRIMITIVES (Overview)


Secure Hosts:
----------------
The host where the cluster is running must be secure hosts which means:
 . Password based authentication disabled
 . SSH Key based authentication only


Secure K8s
------------
With kube-apiserver you can do more or less anything to the k8s cluster, for this reason this kube-apiserver must be authenticated.

 . Who can access? Authentication
	You have different choice:
	- Files - Username and Passwords
	- Files - Username and Tokens

 . What can they do?
	- RoleBaseAccessControl (RBAC) Authorization
	- AttributeBaseAccessControl (ABAC) Authorization
	- Node Authorization
	- Webhook node.


TLS Certificates
-----------------

Kube ApiServer <==> ETCD Cluster must use TLS Certificate
Kube ApiServer <==> Kube Proxy must use TLS Certificate
Kube ApiServer <==> Kube Scheduler must use TLS Certificate
Kube ApiServer <==> Kubelet must use TLS Certificate
Kube ApiServer <==> Kube Controller Manager Cluster must use TLS Certificate
